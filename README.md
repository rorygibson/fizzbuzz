# fizz

Clojure implementation of FizzBuzz Kata (with "lucky" extension)
Currently Steps 1 & 2 complete.

Step 1
======
Write a program that prints a contiguous sequence of numbers, but for multiples of three print ìFizzî instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ìBuzzî. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ìFizzBuzzî

Step 2
======
Amend your program so that any number that contains "3" (e.g. 3, 13, 23, 30) is printed as "Lucky".

Step 3
======
Amend your program so that it reports how many values have been output as:
Fizz
Buzz
FizzBuzz
Lucky
The integer
